## Slide 3
Offender need not be white, cis, hetero male. "no one is free from inheriting the racial, gender and sexual orientation biases of this society."

Not using the word "victim” because it carries connotations of helplessness, powerlessness. And really, we're all victims of societal, cultural biases

## Slide 6
Plausible deniability/unawareness - "I just picked someone at random to take notes. It has nothing to do with the fact that you're a woman."

## Slide 7
"Woman" tasks - making coffee, handling HR stuff, communicating with clients, taking notes.

## Slide 8
So in this situation, it's totally unclear whether or not the fact that the one dev is female is a factor in the male dev asking if she is mostly front-end. It could be that the male dev just noticed that the female dev seemed less experienced/didn't know what he was talking about.

## Slide 9
In this situation, there is some history. The female developer is brand new to coding in a professional setting. The more experienced developer knows that the female dev's partner is highly technical. This is also one occurrence in a chain of ongoing incidents of this kind. This likely wouldn’t have happened to a male developer with a technical partner, regardless of his experience level.

## Slide 11
What do you do when you find yourself the target of a microaggression? How do you respond? Do you respond at all? What are your priorities and concerns when responding?

This is sort of a dissection of my personal process. It's just one approach. Every response is valid.

## Slide 13
Intend no harm is different from “do no harm”. We can’t control the impact of our behaviors and words. But we can control our intent.

## Slide 15
This is sort of an overarching life philosophy for me. When dealing with adults, no one needs to be anyone else's parent or caretaker. If I don't take care of myself, I'm leaving that job to someone else. Self-compassion first, compassion for others if there's anything left.

## Slide 16
Denying/objecting to my feelings would just increase my own suffering, so those are not compassionate things to do.

## Slide 17
Careful not to hold the community members or subgroup responsible for incident. 

Response will affect community vibe/atmosphere. An increase in awareness might help decrease future incidents of this kind, thereby reducing suffering in the community. This is one possible outcome.

My first responsibility is to myself, so no obligation/justification necessary.

## Slide 18
Tempting to be like “This person is misguided, how can I make them see my point of view?” Not possible! We're all free agents!

We are all capable of harboring bias. I don't want to dismiss a person based on their ignorance or bias. People can change/grow.

Ignorance is suffering.

## Slide 19
Asking for clarification may provide additional context to nullify incident or make issue more clear. Either way, it could make it easier to handle.

Circumstances - What type of environment? How well do you know this person? What is person's cultural background? First-time incident or recurring?

## Slide 21
Maximum impact on community - for better or worse.

Starting a war is the worst possible outcome in my opinion. No one learns, grows. People just latch onto a side and throw insults over the wall. Anger and pain grow and the situation gets worse. Wars increase suffering. Not compassionate.

## Slide 24
Am I dismissing or denying my feelings if I choose not to respond? Or am I doing what I need to do to feel safe?

## Slide 25
There is no algorithm for handling micro aggressions.

## Slide 27,28
The bottom line is that we aren’t going to eradicate bigotry and -isms in our society anytime soon. The best we can do is be responsible for ourselves and hope for the best when it comes to others.
